"""Remap Plex/TVDB episode numbering onto TMDB's season structure.

Plex libraries follow TVDB numbering while TMDB may split, merge, or omit
seasons entirely. Both the history importer and the live webhook path need to
recover the real TMDB (season, episode) instead of dropping or mis-filing the
watch, so the strategies live here and each caller supplies its own season
loader (and therefore its own caching).
